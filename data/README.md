# Calibration data for SHED-Earth ([http://shed.earth](http://shed.earth))

This sub-folder contains all the calibration data used by the [shed.earth](http://shed.earth) website. These data are called by file "*shedcalc/schmidt.py*" in the construction of the TCN-SH calibration curves. 

Files include:

- "Calibration_readme.pdf". This file describes the following data tables in greater detail.
- "Calibration_Balco.csv". This files includes all sample information used for calculating the underlying <sup>10</sup>Be ages, in the format required by the online calculators formerly known as the CRONUS-Earth online calculators (Balco et al. 2008).
- "Calibration_CRONUS.csv". As above, but in the format required by the CRONUS Earth Web Calculator (v2, Marrero et al., 2016).
- "Calibration_Summary.csv". This file includes the results of exposure age calculation, using the default globally-calibrated <sup>10</sup>Be production rate of Borchers et al. (2016), in addition to a range of suitable production rates from the British Isles. 

These data were last updated on: **10/04/2020**
